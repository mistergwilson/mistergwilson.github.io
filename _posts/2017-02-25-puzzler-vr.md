# Virtual Reality Dungeon Puzzler Game

### The third VR experience I had to create for the Udacity nanodegree was a mobile game called Puzzler. Creating this game provided the opportunity to design, test, and iterate a VR experience. In this game, the player is trapped in a dungeon and cannot leave until they solve a “Simon says” like puzzle with glowing orbs.

## Unique Considerations
### I wanted to design the game in a way that was easy for anyone new to virtual reality could pick up and experience. I also wanted to limit any potential sickness that someone could experience from using VR. 

## Puzzler
### The design and experience of the game was a success. People who tried the game were able to navigate the game easily and found it a fun way to be introduced to VR.

## The process

*Statement of purpose: Puzzler is a mobile VR application that introduces kids to virtual reality in a quick, fun, easy to use way.*

## Sketches

### Here are some conceptual sketches that influenced the design of the game.

## Aesthetic and mood


## User Interactions



## User Testing

### I tested with one individual who had no experience with virtual reality. First, I asked the participant about their presence in the environment and what kind of mood it conveyed. The participant felt a little shorter than normal so I had to adjust the camera. She described the environment has dark and spooky. I then had the participant test the UI. She was able to easily navigate the game. Her expected actions of the buttons matched the intended outcomes. I did not need to resize or change the interface at all. We then tested the game experience. Initially, the participant had a hard time figuring out when they selected an orb. This was because a sound would play both when the selector hovered over the orb and when it was clicked. I changed the experience to just have the sound play when the orb was selected and this made the experience much easier for the user. The motion mechanics did not make the user feel uncomfortable.


## Conclusion

### This was a fun game to complete and I am glad that others were able to enjoy an experience I created. I look forward to creating more virtual reality games and experiences.


## Next steps

### Next steps for this project would be to make multiple dungeons containing multiple puzzlers with increased difficulty. I would also try to implement multiple user functionality and create a leaderboard based on how fast a player could escape the dungeon. I would also like to test the game with more people.
