# My favorite VR experience

## I started immersing myself in VR extensively once I became the director of the Innovation Lab at Ross School last fall. I've tried out many games and experiences on Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, and Playstation VR. The experience that amazed me the most was a game called Tethered on Playstation VR.

## I was a big fan of the Sims so this game brought back many memories. The aesthetic is amazing and you really start to feel like a God when you're floating above this world of "Peeps." The purpose of the game is to gather spirit energy while having your peeps obtain resources, assemble building, or fight off threats to their land. Once you free the Spirit Guardian for the island, you move on to the next level. You guide the peeps by tethering or linking them to objects or other peeps. The attention to detail is great in this game. I love how you can view different vintage points of the land by traveling to different clouds. I did not finish the game yet, but I look forward to exploring every island. This was one of the first VR experience that got an audible "wow" from me when I first started playing. A close second would be the Batman: Arkham VR game, also for Playstation VR. I also loved watching a live NBA game in VR, and I think that is the future of at-home sports viewing. 

## I know that we are just scratching the surface when it comes to VR games and experiences and I can't wait to see where we are headed!
